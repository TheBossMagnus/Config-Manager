* Added compatibility with Modrinth App fullscreen settings
* Added German ([GulutGames](https://github.com/TheBossMagnus/Config-Manager/pull/3)) and Malay/Malay
  Jawi ([NuruddinPlays](https://github.com/TheBossMagnus/Config-Manager/pull/2)) translations
* Added support for NeoForge on 1.21.9+
    * Dropped support for NeoForge 1.21.1-9: sadly it's not possible to keep NeoForge compat between 1.21.1-8 and
      1.21.9+ due to huge changes at the internals that are used to run the mod super early
